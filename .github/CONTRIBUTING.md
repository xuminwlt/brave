## How to contribute? ##

*  If you find a bug that can be easily fixed or a small improvement to the codebase feel free to make a pull requests and mention @kristofa in the comments.
*  If you have a feature request or you would like to see larger more structural changes please make a github issue first with a proper explanation. Also mention @kristofa in the issue. We prefer an issue for larger changes to prevent you spend a lot of time to implement the change which might not get accepted to be merged in master.
*  If you have created a pull request make sure the build is green. For every pull request that is being made a build plan will be triggered on [travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org).
