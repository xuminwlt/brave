Java Distributed Tracing implementation compatible with [Zipkin](http://zipkin.io).

Zipkin is based on [Dapper](http://research.google.com/pubs/pub36356.html).

dapper (dutch) = brave (english)... so that's where the name comes from.

## introduction ##

More information on Distributed Tracing and OpenZipkin here: <https://openzipkin.github.io>

You can use brave if you use the JVM and:

*   You can't use [Finagle](https://github.com/twitter/finagle).
*   You don't want to add Scala as a dependency to your Java project.
*   You want out of the box integration support for [RESTEasy](http://resteasy.jboss.org), [Jersey](https://jersey.java.net), [Apache HttpClient](http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-4.3.x/index.html).

Brave is compatible with OpenZipkin backends such as [zipkin-server](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/blob/master/zipkin-server/README.md)
