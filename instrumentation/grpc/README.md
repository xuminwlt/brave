# brave-instrumentation-grpc
This contains tracing client and server interceptors for [grpc](github.com/grpc/grpc-java).

The client interceptor adds trace headers to outgoing requests. The
server interceptor extracts trace state from incoming requests. Both
report to Zipkin how long each request takes, along with relevant
tags like the response status.

To enable tracing for a gRPC application, add the interceptors when when
constructing the client and server bindings:

```java
grpcTracing = GrpcTracing.create(tracing);

Server server = ServerBuilder.forPort(serverPort)
    .addService(ServerInterceptors.intercept(
        GreeterGrpc.bindService(new GreeterImpl()), grpcTracing.newServerInterceptor()))
    .build()
    .start();

ManagedChannel channel = ManagedChannelBuilder.forAddress("localhost", serverPort)
    .intercept(grpcTracing.newClientInterceptor())
    .usePlaintext(true)
    .build();
```

## Development

If you are working on this module, then you need to run `mvn install` to first compile the protos. Once the protos are compiled, then can be found in the directories:

`
./target/generated-test-sources/protobuf/grpc-java
./target/generated-test-sources/protobuf/java
`

You may need to add the above directories as test sources in your IDE.
